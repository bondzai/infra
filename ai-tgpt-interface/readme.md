# Project Files Structure
.
├── .gitignore
├── ai.sh
├── install.sh
├── prompt.txt

This is a simple project repository containing four files for managing and running a Bash script:

- .gitignore: This file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by git.
- ai.sh: This is the main Bash script for this project.
- install.sh: This is a helper script for installing any dependencies required by the project.
- prompt.txt: This is a text file containing user prompts that are used by the ai.sh script.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the install.sh script to ensure any necessary dependencies are installed.
3. Modify the prompt.txt file to customize the user prompts used by the ai.sh script.
4. Run the ai.sh script to start the program.

The ai.sh script will prompt the user for input based on the contents of prompt.txt, and then perform some action based on the user's response.

## Best Practices

Here are some best practices to keep in mind when working with Bash scripts:

- Use meaningful variable names to make your code easier to read and understand.
- Comment your code thoroughly to explain what each section does.
- Use functions to break up long scripts into smaller, more manageable pieces.
- Always validate user input to prevent errors or unexpected behavior.
- Use version control like git to track changes and collaborate with others effectively.

By following these best practices, you can create reliable, maintainable Bash scripts that are easy to work with and understand.
