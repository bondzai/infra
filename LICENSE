Feel free to tinker, tweak, and tango with this software. Just don't blame us if things get wild. You've got the green light to use it, modify it, and even sell it, but remember, it comes with no guarantees. The nerds behind this code won't take the fall if things go south. Play safe, back up your stuff, and test it out before rolling the dice in a live environment. Happy coding! ðŸ˜ŽðŸš€
